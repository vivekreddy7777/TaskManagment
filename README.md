The service is currently processing and updating the records. Once the update is complete, I will verify that all IDs are in sync and share an update.

If there are any missing or mismatched records, I will rerun the process for those IDs. I am also working on a permanent fix to understand why certain records are failing and prevent this from happening again in the future.
